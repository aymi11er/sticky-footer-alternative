        Site © Somebody. By using CSS to set a dark color on <code>html</code> and
        <code>footer</code>, and a lighter color on <code>body</code>, this footer appears to occupy
        the remainder of the page, no matter how much taller the page is. It doesn't rely on height
        hacks with viewport units or anything. Just tasteful padding, set to the baseline grid, and
        some color. See the CSS on lines 24–55.
